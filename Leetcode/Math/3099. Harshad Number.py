"""
An integer divisible by the sum of its digits is said to be a Harshad number. You are given an integer x. Return the sum of the digits of x if x is a Harshad number, otherwise, return -1.



Example 1:

Input: x = 18

Output: 9

Explanation:

The sum of digits of x is 9. 18 is divisible by 9. So 18 is a Harshad number and the answer is 9.
